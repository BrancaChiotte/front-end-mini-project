        <p>
          I think this should be fairly easy so if you just want to have a look
          i'll know it when i see it, and i'll pay you in a week we don't need
          to pay upfront i hope you understand the flier should feel like a warm
          handshake. Can you make the logo bigger yes bigger bigger still the
          logo is too big the flier should feel like a warm handshake I like it,
          but can the snow look a little warmer this turned out different that i
          decscribed but can you rework to make the pizza look more delicious. I
          think we need to start from scratch I need a website. How much will it
          cost, so I think we need to start from scratch. Other agencies charge
          much lesser mmm, exactly like that, but different, can you make it
          more infographic-y but this is just a 5 minutes job. We exceed the
          clients' expectations can you please change the color theme of the
          website to pink and purple?
